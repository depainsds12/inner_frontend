### .vscode Folder

The **`.vscode/`** folder contains configuration files specific to Visual Studio Code (VSCode), which is a popular code editor. This folder can include settings and extensions configurations that enhance the development experience for users working on this project.

#### Common Contents of the .vscode Folder:

- **`settings.json`**: This file allows you to define workspace-specific settings for VSCode, such as editor preferences, formatting options, and linting rules. It ensures that all developers working on the project have a consistent development environment.

- **`extensions.json`**: This file can suggest recommended extensions for the project. When a developer opens the project in VSCode, they will be prompted to install the listed extensions, which can improve productivity and code quality.

### Husky Pre-Commit Hook

Husky is a tool that allows you to manage Git hooks easily. The **pre-commit hook** is a specific type of hook that runs before a commit is finalized. In this project, Husky is configured to run linting and formatting checks before allowing a commit. This ensures that only code that meets the defined quality standards is committed, helping to maintain a clean and consistent codebase.

### GitHub Workflows

GitHub workflows are automated processes that you can set up in your GitHub repository to perform tasks such as testing, building, and deploying your application. These workflows are defined in YAML files located in the `.github/workflows` directory. They can be triggered by various events, such as pushing code to a branch or creating a pull request. Setting up workflows helps automate repetitive tasks, ensuring that your code is tested and deployed consistently.

### Tailwind CSS Configuration

The **`tailwind.config.js`** file is used to configure Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. This file allows you to customize various aspects of Tailwind, such as theme colors, spacing, and breakpoints. You can also specify which files Tailwind should scan for class names to generate the appropriate styles, ensuring that your final CSS is optimized and only includes the styles you use.

### Next.js Configuration

The **`next.config.mjs`** file is used to configure Next.js, a React framework for building server-rendered applications. This file allows you to customize various settings, such as enabling experimental features, setting up redirects, and configuring environment variables. It helps tailor the behavior of your Next.js application to meet specific requirements.

### Playwright Configuration

The **`playwright.config.mjs`** file is used to configure Playwright, a testing framework for end-to-end testing of web applications. This file allows you to specify settings such as the browsers to test, the base URL of your application, and any global test settings. It helps streamline the testing process and ensures consistent test execution.

### PostCSS Configuration

The **`postcss.config.mjs`** file is used to configure PostCSS, a tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins. This file allows you to specify which plugins to use for processing your CSS, such as autoprefixing, minification, or custom transformations. It helps in optimizing and enhancing your CSS workflow.

### Prettier Configuration

The **`.prettierrc.json`** file is used to configure Prettier, a code formatter that helps maintain consistent code style across your project. This file allows you to specify formatting rules such as indentation, line length, and whether to use single or double quotes.

### Typescript Configuration

The **`tsconfig.json`** file is used to configure TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. This file allows you to specify compiler options, such as target ECMAScript version, module resolution strategy, and type checking behavior. It helps ensure type safety and provides better tooling support for your project.

## ESLint Configuration

The **`.eslintrc.json`** file is used to configure ESLint, a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. This helps maintain code quality and consistency across the project.

## Zustand Store

The **`store/`** directory contains the Zustand store, which is used for state management in your application. Zustand is a small, fast, and scalable state management solution that allows you to manage global state with minimal boilerplate.

#### Structure of the Store Folder

```
store/
├── useStore.js            # Main Zustand store file
```
